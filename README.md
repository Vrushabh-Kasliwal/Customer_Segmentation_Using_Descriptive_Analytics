# Customer Segmentation Using Descriptive Analytics

## Project Overview

## Key Insights
### Product Insights:
- Three unique products: KP281, KP481, KP781
- KP281 is the most frequently purchased product
- Higher income and higher weekly mileage increase the likelihood of purchasing KP781

### Customer Demographics:
- Mean age: ~29 years (range: 18-50 years)
- 75% of customers are aged 18-33, indicating a younger audience
- Mean education duration: 15.57 years; 75% have 16 or fewer years of education
